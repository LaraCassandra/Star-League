## **Introduction**

---

**The Brief**

The project required me to create an interactive dashboard making use of NPM, ReactJS and an API of my choice, as well as several other technologies - such as ChartJS, Yarn, Fetch and Axios. The information was required to be populated by an API that allowed users to compare information and choose what information they want to view.

**The Project**

Rocket League is a dynamic single page website that allows users to view visually displayed information, populated by the SpaceX API.

This project assumes you have NPM. Before beginning, please make sure you have NPM correctly installed.

**You can check in the console by using:**

```
$ npm -v
```

You can download NodeJS at <https://nodejs.org/en/download/> <br>
This will automatically download NPM.
